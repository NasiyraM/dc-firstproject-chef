<h3> What you need: </h3>

<ul> 
  <li>  4 pound (2kg) whole chicken, at room temperature giblets and neck removed from cavity*    
  </li>
  <li> 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 
  </li>
  <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil 
  </li>
  <li> 1/4 cup of dry white wine (optional, but adds so much flavor to the meat while keeping it so juicy)
      <br> **use a dry wine like a Sauv blanc or Chardonnay  
  </li>
  <li> 1 lemon, halved
  </li> 
  <li> Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
  </li> 
  <li> 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
  </li>
  <li> 4 garlic cloves, minced
  </li> 
  <li> 1 head of garlic roughly peeled and cut in half horizontally through the middle crosswise
  </li> 
  <li> 3 fresh whole rosemary sprigs
  </li>   
</ul>

<h3> Now lets get started! </h3>
<ol>
 <li> Preheat oven to 430°F | 220°C (400°F or 200°C fan forced). Line a baking tray with foil, or lightly grease a roasting pan.
 </li>
 <li> Discard neck from inside the cavity and remove any excess fat and leftover feathers. Pat dry with paper towels.
 </li>
 <li> Pour the olive oil, melted butter, wine (if using) and the juice of half a lemon over the chicken, under the skin and 
    inside the cavity. <br> Season chicken liberally on the outside and inside the cavity with salt and pepper. 
    Sprinkle over the parsley.
 </li>
 <li> Rub the minced garlic over the chicken, mixing all ingredients together over the chicken and under the skin.
 </li>
 <li> Stuff the garlic head into the chicken cavity along with the rosemary sprigs and the squeezed lemon halve. 
    Tie legs together with kitchen string.   
 </li>
 <li> Place breast-side up into baking tray or roasting pan. Roast for 1 hour and 15-20 minutes, basting half way through 
    cooking time, <br> until juices run clear when chicken thigh is pierced with a skewer. 
 </li>
 <li>Baste again, then broil for a further 2-3 minutes, until golden.   
 </li>
 <li> Remove from the oven, cover with foil and allow to stand for 10 minutes before serving. 
   <br> Serve, drizzled with pan juices and remaining lemon half cut into wedges or slices.
 </li>
</ol>

 <h3> Notes </h3>
 <p> For a larger chicken, roast at 430°F (220°C), 0r 400°F (200°C) fan forced, for one hour. 
     Then, reduce oven temperature down to 325 (160°C). <br> Baste and cover chicken. Roast, 
     basting 2 more times while cooking, until chicken is cooked through, about 45 mins to an hour. 
     <br> Internal temperature should read 165°F (75°C) and juices run clear when pierced.
